## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for recognizing handwritten characters using a dataset like **EMNIST** (Extended MNIST). The current code uses the MNIST dataset as a placeholder, but it can be modified to use the EMNIST dataset once itâ€™s downloaded and processed. The CNN model classifies handwritten digits (0-9) by learning patterns from images. The model uses a series of convolutional layers followed by dense layers to make predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - tensorflow
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Dataset

The code loads the MNIST dataset as a placeholder. The dataset is normalized, reshaped, and converted into one-hot encoded labels.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load the dataset (can replace with EMNIST)
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the dataset (reshape and normalize)
X_train = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255.0
X_test = X_test.reshape((X_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

### Step 2: Build the CNN Model

The model is built using the Keras Sequential API with three convolutional layers, followed by a dense layer and an output layer.

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Create the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Step 3: Compile and Train the Model

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Then, it is trained using the training dataset.

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

### Step 4: Evaluate and Make Predictions

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set and predictions are made.

```python
# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Display a sample image with the predicted label
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(X_test[0].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')
plt.title(f"Predicted: {np.argmax(predictions[0])}")
plt.show()
```

## Dataset

This code uses the **MNIST dataset** (a subset of the EMNIST dataset) for handwritten digit recognition. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and is commonly used for training image recognition models. 

You can download the **EMNIST dataset** (if using it instead of MNIST) from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/emnist).

## Model Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed as follows:

1. **Conv2D** layer with 32 filters of size 3x3, followed by **MaxPooling2D**.
2. **Conv2D** layer with 64 filters of size 3x3, followed by **MaxPooling2D**.
3. **Conv2D** layer with 64 filters of size 3x3.
4. **Flatten** layer to convert the 2D features into 1D.
5. **Dense** layer with 64 units and ReLU activation.
6. **Dense** output layer with 10 units (for digits 0-9) and Softmax activation.

## Results

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is displayed.

```bash
Test accuracy: 99.01%
```

A sample image from the test set will also be displayed with the predicted label.
